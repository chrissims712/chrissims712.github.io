What to do next?
Create fields that show what activites can be done on each trail that is explicitly listed for motorized use.




SIDE NOTE:
See if it is possible to add all layers in 4.2 but display them as graphics. Might be a get around for the feature limit of featureLayers.




WorkFlow for query in example:
1. query results based on well type.
2. creates buffer around these wells at user specified distance.
3. query earthquakes within buffers.

"WorkFlow" for my query (test query).
1. query results based on trail usage.
2. query results based on length of trail.
ALSO WILL NEED RANGE OF TRAILS NOT JUST ONE DISTANCE...
